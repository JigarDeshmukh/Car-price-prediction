       5]  Model implementation
       
       6] Hyper parameter Tuning
       
       7] Overall Accuracy

CONCLUSION

      1] By Applying 3 different model on the dataset Regression,Random Forest,Decision Tree

      2] As Decision Tree gave higher accuracy but after hyperparameter tuning i conclude that the accuracy decreased

      3] Thus Hyper Tuning for the Decision Tree Give highest Accuracy to 81 % Followed by Voting Regressor with 79.71

      4] So overall accuracy of the model is 77%
